# Advice on Analysis
Make an autopilot script for your analyses, so that figures (and even posters if you are feeling ambitious) are updated in real time while the data is collected. You can find some examples here. When I collect data, all of my imaging and behavioral analyses are updated and I get an email at the end of the day with figures. I literally do not intervene - this has saved me hundreds of hours. 

Use jupyter notebook for development of analysis pipelines.

Use atom for writing experimental code, scanner code, all other code besides interactive analysis. 
(Run scripts from atom with package "script")

Make a startup file so that your figures always are publication quality, from the get go, without modification. Save files in svg, or eps always. Just stop using pngs all together. 

# Programming Advice
Become a pro at bash syntax - it will seriously save you a lot of time.

Use shell scripts when you must, but these days python is quite the shapeshifter. 

Hotkey things, get a mechanical keyboard so your labmates love you. Hotkey more things.

# Statistics
Learn to love Bayes, if you don't already. 
This is an introduction on bayesian vs. frequentism

Beware of p-values. Stop using them if you can. Avoid null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). 

As soon as possible, understand bootstraping, cross validation and the permutation test.

# Researching
Before you start down some major project that you will be committed to for years, understand the current literature in your topic. Understand very clearly why you are going to do what you are going to do. 
Find articles before they are officially published on arxiv
Don't discount social media
Pubmed
Google-scholar
PaperPile (and its integration with Pubmed)

# Advice for meetings with PI
Never show up empty handed to meetings with your PI, 
Have a clear objective to the meeting
Be able to show some evidence of your productivity. 

The rainy day folder:
You will have some weeks where nothing worked and you will have to meet with your PI without the thing you were supposed to have. I found that in those cases it is very useful to have a "rainy day" folder containing interesting analyses/figures your advisor has not yet seen.
